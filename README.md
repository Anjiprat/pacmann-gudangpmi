An analytics project using Palang Merah Indonesia's warehouse shipment data.


# Background
Palang Merah Indonesia is a humanitarian organization based in Indonesia. During the COVID-19 pandemic, they constructed seven temporary warehouses in Jakarta to help distribute logistics for COVID-19 related aid throughout the country. The dataset refers to shipments to and from these temporary warehouses. 

# Objectives
With this dataset, I aimed to create a simple dashboard in Tableau to help central logistic managers in their job, namely to assess warehouse stock and make decisions on shipments and procurement of goods. The dashboard is designed to so that central logistic managers can easily get information about warehouse stock, the types of items needed, and predict incoming demands via the flow of goods as well as COVID-19 status per province.
